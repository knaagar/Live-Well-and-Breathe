        <h2>Our goal</h2>
        <p>Our goal is to help others achieve theirs. Really! We want you to be able to take care of yourself. This is simply a tool to help. We all have a responsibility to take care of ourselves, but too many people don't do so responsibly. Shaming or telling them they need to change isn't an option. In this age, everything moves so quickly, we don't have time to take care of ourselves. Everything is what's next, not what's now.</p>
        <p>and easy options are all too often presented to us, and even the "solutions" to fix these problems follow the same quick and easy philosophy. The thing is, our bodies aren't made to be quick and easy. We need to care for ourselves, and sometimes we need a little help to do that. If we're provided with the tools to help ourselves, we will. </p>
