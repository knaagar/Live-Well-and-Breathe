        <p>We want to make it easier than ever before for average everyday people to enjoy better than average health without expensive subscriptions or professional help, which, in many cases, are way beyond practicality. You shouldn't need to pay someone else to tell you how to eat healthier or stay on top of crippling mental states caused by poor physical state. With Live Well, you don't have to pay or depend on someone else for everything. </p>
